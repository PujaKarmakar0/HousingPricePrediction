# HousingPricePrediction
Part of 3rd Programming Competition Artificial Intelligence &amp; Machine Learning held on University of Bahrain (Hackathon for 3 days)

Problem:
Predicting the Sale price of house based on its features. Addressing Non-linearity, outliners, Data and Model evaluation and analysis.

Metric of Evaluation:
Submissions are evaluated on Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price. 

Models:
We tried many techniques like XGBoost Regression (0.14672), Random Forest Regression (0.17646),
Gradient Boosting (0.20), Neural Networks (0.24278), Decision Tree (0.25), LGBM Regression (0.30) and SVM (0.53)
